🧁 Bakery Management System (Production to Sales)
A full-stack application designed to streamline and automate the entire operational workflow of a modern bakery, from raw material inventory to final sales reporting.

🌟 Project Overview
The Bakery Management System is a mission-critical application intended to replace manual, error-prone processes within a bakery's daily operations. By creating a unified platform, we aim to deliver a solution that ensures data integrity, increases operational efficiency, and provides real-time visibility across the business.

This system covers five core functional areas:

Raw Material Inventory Management: Tracking stock levels, usage, and reorder points for all ingredients.

Daily Production Tracking: Managing recipes, scheduling batches, and recording daily output.

Sales Monitoring: Processing transactions and tracking sales data.

Dashboard: Display live item tracking and provide a basic analysis report.

Reporting & Analytics: Generating key reports on costs and profitability.
