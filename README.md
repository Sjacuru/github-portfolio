Bakery Project Emam and Salim

üßÅ Bakery Management System (Production to Sales)
A full-stack application designed to streamline and automate the entire operational workflow of a modern bakery, from raw material inventory to final sales reporting.

üåü Project Overview
The Bakery Management System is a mission-critical application intended to replace manual, error-prone processes within a bakery's daily operations. By creating a unified platform, we aim to deliver a solution that ensures data integrity, increases operational efficiency, and provides real-time visibility across the business. 

Development Approach (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

Our initial focus will be on developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), prioritizing the most essential features required for core functionality. The system is designed to be fully scalable and will be incremented with new features over time based on business needs and user feedback.

This system covers five core functional areas:

Raw Material Inventory Management: Tracking stock levels, usage, and reorder points for all ingredients.

Daily Production Tracking: Managing recipes, scheduling batches, and recording daily output.

Sales Monitoring: Processing transactions and tracking sales data.

Dashboard: Display live item tracking and provide a basic analysis report. Docker will be used for version control and system demonstrations.

Reporting & Analytics: Generating key reports on costs and profitability. 

Django models are the source of truth; to apply migrations run "docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate".
